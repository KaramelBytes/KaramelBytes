# Hey there! 👋 I'm a Vibe Coder from Brunei 🇧🇳

> **20+ years in tech** → **AI-powered development obsession** → **Building the future, one experiment at a time**

## What's Vibe Coding? 🎯

I practice **AI-powered intuitive development** - combining decades of tech experience with cutting-edge AI models to build projects that feel right, work well, and push boundaries. Every repository here represents experiments in human-AI collaboration, where proven problem-solving meets bleeding-edge innovation.

**My approach**: Conception → AI-assisted development → deployed MVP → iterate or fork into something even cooler.

## The Journey 🛤️

- **Tech veteran** diving deep into AI-powered development
- **Based in Brunei Darussalam** 🏝️
- **Philosophy**: Adapt and innovate - stay ahead of the curve through hands-on exploration
- **Method**: Learning by building progressively complex projects with AI as my development team

## What I'm Building 🚀

**Current Focus**: Static Site Generators (SSGs) - Mastering AI-assisted full-stack development

**The Progression**: 
- 🌐 **Web & Mobile Applications** - Next level complexity
- 🤖 **Chatbots & Discord Bots** - Conversational AI experiments  
- 🎮 **Video Games** - Interactive experiences
- 🔬 **AI Development Tools** - Meta-tools for AI-assisted development

**The Process**: Each project pushes the boundaries of what's possible when human creativity meets AI capability. **Language-agnostic approach** - I use whatever the project needs and whatever I haven't tried before. Currently exploring SSGs, but tomorrow might bring completely different tech stacks.

## My AI Interests 🧠

- **Prompt Engineering**: Perfecting human-AI communication
- **Model Experimentation**: Always testing the latest releases
- **Development Workflows**: Optimizing AI-assisted coding practices
- **Future-Proofing**: Building skills for the AI-native development era
