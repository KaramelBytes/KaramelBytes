## What I'm Building üöÄ

**Current Focus**: Conversational AI & Discord Bots - Building complex multi-service platforms with enterprise-grade features

**Recent Releases**: 2 public chatbots, 1 complex Discord bot platform in active development

**The Progression**: 
- ü§ñ **Advanced Bot Platforms** - Multi-service architectures with security, concurrency, and scalability ‚ú® *Current*
- üåê **Enterprise Web Applications** - Full-stack platforms with real-time collaboration
- üéÆ **Interactive Experiences** - Games and immersive applications
- üî¨ **AI Development Frameworks** - Tools for AI-assisted development workflows

**The Process**: Each project pushes the boundaries of what's possible when human creativity meets AI capability. **Language-agnostic approach** - I use whatever the project needs and whatever I haven't tried before. Currently deep in Python, Discord.py, and enterprise architecture patterns, but always ready to explore new stacks.
